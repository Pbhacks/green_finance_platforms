# Green Finance Optimization Platform

This is an AI-powered Green Finance Optimization Platform that helps financial institutions optimize and allocate investments for sustainability projects based on their environmental, social, and governance (ESG) impact. The platform evaluates and scores projects, optimizes investment portfolios, and provides interactive visualizations.

## Features

- **Data Upload & Processing**: Users can upload project data in CSV format and process it with predefined ESG metrics like emissions reduction, cost, risk, and KPI.
- **Project Scoring**: The platform scores each project based on a combination of ESG factors, ensuring the most impactful projects are prioritized.
- **Investment Optimization**: The system uses linear programming to optimize investment allocation within a given budget while maximizing ESG impact.
- **Interactive Dashboard**: A user-friendly graphical interface allows users to interact with the data, score projects, and view optimized results in real-time.

## How It Works

1. **Data Collection**: Users upload project data in CSV format. This data includes metrics like emissions reduction, project cost, risk factor, and KPI.
2. **Project Scoring**: The platform uses predefined weights for various ESG metrics to score each project. Higher scores indicate better sustainability outcomes.
3. **Investment Optimization**: The optimization engine uses linear programming to recommend the best investment allocation across multiple projects, maximizing overall ESG impact within a budget constraint.
4. **Visualization**: The results are displayed in an easy-to-read table, showing the project scores and their optimized allocations.

## Key Technologies

- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **Tkinter**: For building the GUI (Graphical User Interface).
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and processing.
- **SciPy**: For optimization using linear programming.
